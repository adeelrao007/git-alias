rebase/change author for wrong commits


Changing the Username of Multiple Past Commits:
Start an interactive rebase.
Code

    git rebase -i <commit-id>^
Replace <commit-id> with the hash of the commit before the first commit you want to change. The ^ indicates the parent of that commit. Edit the rebase instructions. 
In the text editor that opens, change pick to edit for each commit whose author you want to change. Save and close the editor. Amend each commit. 
Git will stop at each commit marked for edit. For each one, run:
Code

    git commit --amend --author="New Author Name <new.author@example.com>" --no-edit
The --no-edit flag prevents Git from opening the commit message editor again. Continue the rebase.
Code

    git rebase --continue
Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all desired commits have been amended. Force push the changes.
Code

    git push --force-with-lease
